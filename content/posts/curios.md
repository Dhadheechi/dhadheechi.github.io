title: 'Where are the curios people?'

Literally. Where are the people who pursue things just for fun? Ever since mid-June, I've started seeing my fellow classmates grinding DSA non-stop. Purpose? To crack the Software Engineering OA's and interviews. Even in my department, AI, I've seen people interested in AI take a right turn and start leetcode/cp for the sake of internships. A few of them even admit that DSA is quite boring, but they have no other choice because that's all they ask during the interviews. I myself didn't do any DSA this summer, and yet I'm giving all these Online Assessments that I have zero interest in. I have a google OA today at 12pm, and, as of now at 10:20 AM, I haven't solved a single leetcode problem. I spent all my holidays playing tennis in the morning, and studying whatever interested me for the rest of the day (LLMs in May, Deep RL in June, Deepseek Architectures, Computer vision, and Diffusion models in July). So far I've managed to stay away from the crowd and follow my own thing. But now that I'm in my campus surrounded by people everywhere who do the DSA stuff (including my AI classmates), I wonder if I'm a bit too alone.

I mean, what has happened to us? Why have we stopped being curious about what we study, and made it as a means toward an end goal? -- Internships, Placements, etc. What happened to the inner child in us -- who just keeps asking questions to satisfy his/her curiosity? In my opinion, the root cause is [the jee-fication of everything](https://akshit2003.substack.com/p/the-jee-fication-of-everything). When everything is brought down to a metric (eg: CGPA, codeforces rating, package amount), there's little room to explore new stuff. Everybody tries to copy the person who has the highest score in the pre-defined metric. This mindset, unfortunately has stayed with many students even after cracking IIT, as evident in most of my classmates. Few people here are trying to do anything on their own. We're just following a path that someone else laid for us, without even questioning it. It feels like it's just all exploitation, and no exploration. 

Did Linus Torvalds write linux so that it would be a good point on his CV? If that were the case, I bet the software wouldn't be half as good as it is today. He wasn't looking to write linux as a **means to an end** -- he did it just because that's what drove him. 

I thought my experience at IIT would be like exploring a world where people do crazy experiments, talk about new research, and just be open-minded and curious. But the sad reality here is that this place is turning into a factory that produces people who can grind leetcode patterns and solve DSA problems, at the expense of curiosity, and independent minded-ness.

As of myself, I've decided to quit this rat race of people who just grind DSA non-stop. I've chosen my own route -- following my AI interests whole-heartedly. I may fail and the others may succeed, but at least I can be proud that I've chosen my own path instead of just following one that isn't mine.
